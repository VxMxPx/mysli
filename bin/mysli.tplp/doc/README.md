# Mysli Tplp

Tplp is a template parser.

Templates can be parsed and cached on request, but it's better idea to
pre-process them and save them in your package root. This can be done with
command line interface (see **CLI** section).

Tplp works with regular PHP files too. You can completely avoid it, by just
creating normal files with `.php` extention.
